# Introduction

Jetstream is a sophisticated command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to facilitate the creation of short videos on Roblox without relying on Roblox’s proprietary solution.

The tool operates by processing a video (or GIF) into a series of individual frames. Subsequently, it utilizes Roblox’s Cloud API to upload these frames to the platform.

## Why Jetstream?

Roblox videos at their current state are WAY too expensive and offer many limitations for most developers.

Having to spend 2,000 Robux for a short 30-second video or, most likely for many developers, a GIF, is discouraging for indie games because of its expense.

If you'd like to upload something longer than 30 seconds, it gets more expensive.

## Who is Jetstream made for?

As mentioned earlier, Jetstream is primarily designed for indie developers who lack a substantial budget. Frame uploading can be time-consuming, especially for longer videos with more frames.

However, for higher-earning developers whose Roblox videos are within budget, I suggest using Roblox's videos over Jetstream. Roblox’s video maintenance and ease-of-use are undoubtedly superior.
