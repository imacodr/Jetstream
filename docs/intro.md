# Introduction

Jetstream is a sophisticated command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to facilitate the creation of short videos on Roblox without relying on Roblox’s proprietary solution.

The tool operates by processing a video (or GIF) into a series of individual frames. Subsequently, it utilizes Roblox’s Cloud API to upload these frames to the platform.

---

## Why Jetstream?

Roblox videos at their current state are WAY too expensive and offer many limitations for most developers.

Having to spend 2,000 Robux for a short 30-second video or, most likely for many developers, a GIF, is discouraging for indie games because of its expense.

If you'd like to upload something longer than 30 seconds, it gets more expensive.

## Who is Jetstream made for?

As mentioned earlier, Jetstream is primarily designed for indie developers who lack a substantial budget. Frame uploading can be time-consuming, especially for longer videos with more frames.

However, for higher-earning developers whose Roblox videos are within budget, I suggest using Roblox's videos over Jetstream. Roblox’s video maintenance and ease-of-use are undoubtedly superior.

## Why did I choose this method?

Bringing this to attention, I've seen methods such as loading external images (and GIFs) by parsing their binary data and redrawing the image. However, Roblox has publicly adressed that this method is against their policies and would not pass moderation. Frame splicing has been around on Roblox for a while and it is allowed but its always been a hastle.

## Disadvantages

I won't lie that there are disadvantages for Jetstream.

Frame splicing is not exactly the most efficient method of playing a video as you can probably guess. It is very much a *cheaty* way of putting videos on Roblox. There are many limitations that I won't discuss, specially perfomance wise that might require you to do a bit of tweaking to achieve good performance times with long videos. However, short videos have been shown to work pretty well.
