# Your First Project!

Now that you have all your settings completed lets go into your first Jetstream project.

Start it up by running the following command:

```sh
jetstream create
```

### Name

You will then be prompted for a name:

```
Name your project:
```
!!! danger "Project Name and Roblox"
    Please make sure your project name abides by Roblox moderation. 
    It will be used when uploading your assets later on in project creation.
    
### Video Path

Afterwards you will be prompted for your video path. **This can be a LINK or a LOCAL FILE**

Here is one you can use if you'd like to test

[https://media.tenor.com/u5C5L37eNkQAAAAi/hello-hi.gif](https://media.tenor.com/u5C5L37eNkQAAAAi/hello-hi.gif)

```
Provide path to video (You can drag it here!):
```

If its a local file make sure you provide a valid path. (EX: `/Users/imacodr/Downloads/cat.gif`)

## Jetstream Processing

Once you finish providing these inputs Jetstream will begin its video processing.

This is the process Jetstream goes through to create your video:


1. Frame Splicing
2. Roblox Uploading
3. Decal ID -> Image ID conversion
4. Flightpath Script generated

!!! warning "Wait Time"
    This processing time may take a while and rate limits may occur.

While you wait for your build to process I advise continue reading the documentation.
